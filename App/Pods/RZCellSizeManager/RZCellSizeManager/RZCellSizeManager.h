/**
 *  RZCellSizeManager
 *
 *  RZCellSizeManager is an object that streamlines the management of dynamic UITableViewCell heights or UICollectionViewCell sizes.
 *  All sizes calculated will be cached so that look-up times will be much faster for additional calls for the size of a cell based 
 *  on an index path. The cached heights can be invalidated at any time by indexPath or for the entire cache.

/**
 *  Registers a cell by its class name for a particular data object class. 
 *  The size/height will be computed automatically by autolayout after the cell is configured by a required block.
 *
 *  This flavor of registration is useful for registering a cell that represents an instance of 
 *  a model object if the cell's size/height can be determined by autolayout and the data in the object.
 *
 *  @warning    The configuration of the cell within the block should be simple and efficient.
 *              Cells with lots of autolayout constraints may slow down the responseiveness of the UI during size/height computation.
 *              If the cell configuration is complex, it may be better to use a size/height block registration instead.
 *
 *  @param cellClass          Name of the cell class. Must not be nil.
 *  @param nibNameOrNil       Name of the nib file representing the cell, or nil to use the default name (or if there is no nib)
 *  @param objectClass        Class of the model object this cell represents, or Nil to use this block for all cells.
 *  @param configurationBlock Block which is passed a pointer to the cell as well as a pointer to the model object, if applicable.
 *                            The block should configure the cell's subviews from the model object. Must not be nil.
